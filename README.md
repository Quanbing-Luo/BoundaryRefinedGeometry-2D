# BoundaryRefinedGeometry-2D
 
This repository includes the source code for the paper: 
-  **Quanbing Luo**, Geometry-adaptive boundary edge refinement method and its application for mesh generation on  two-dimensional regions, Submitted to Journal. 

<!-- [Engineering with Computers](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00366-020-01262-x), 2021 (Published Online) -->

The source code is divided to four parts: (1) Geometry, (2) InitialMesh, (3) Mesh and (4) OptimizedMesh. 

## (1) Geometry

The source code of Geometry provided the method to generate the geometry data needed for InitialMesh program. 

 
## (2) InitialMesh

The source code of InitialMesh provided the method to generate the InitialMesh data (Boundary-refined Geometry) needed for Mesh program. 

## (3) Mesh

The source code of Mesh provided the method to generate the Mesh data  needed for OptimizedMesh program. 

## (4) OptimizedMesh

The source code of OptimizedMesh generates the finaloptimized mesh data. 


**Notice:** The source code does not provide data files. You should generate the data files step by step. There is a Figure.m program in each program directory to draw the figure of generated data.
